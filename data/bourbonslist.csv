These barrels we set aside for extended aging and when they reach their peak we hand bottle, sign and stamp these gems to release in extremely limited quantity. These bottles represent only the finest expression of Breckenridge Bourbon Whiskey. Rich, sumptuous top notes of toffee and caramel give way to clean burnt orange and butterscotch on the palate. Strong spicy undertones with a balanced oak profile and a fleeting hint of solvent-like ester notes, which manifest as banana peel and passion fruit. Long, reverberating finish carries the richness and balance of a classic Bourbon Whiskey"

Only ingredients of the very highest quality are used. The subtlety and complexity of Bulleit Bourbon come from its unique blend of rye, corn, and barley malt, along with special strains of yeast and pure Kentucky limestone filtered water. Due to its especially high rye content, Bulleit Bourbon has a bold, spicy character with a finish that's distinctively clean and smooth. Medium amber in color, with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas. Mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak, and nutmeg. Finish is long, dry, and satiny with a light toffee flavor."

This rounds out the spices in the bourbon, while adding a touch of oak to it. "
